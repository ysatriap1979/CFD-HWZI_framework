# CFD-HWZI_framework
The CFD-HWZI_framework is a Python-based code designed for high-wind zone identification (HWZI) using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation results. 
This framework operates with a single script, determineHWZI.py, which processes the input data and identifies potential high-wind zones for wind farm mapping in complex terrains.
The script requires five input files:
Four .csv files containing velocity field data from CFD simulations. These files represent wind speed distributions under different directional scenarios at various locations around the terrain.
One .stl file, which contains the topographic geometry data of Lemukutan Island. This file is crucial for modeling the terrain and understanding how the wind interacts with the islandâ€™s surface features.
The framework enables users to process the CFD simulation data and generate outputs relevant for high-wind zone identification, which can be used for further analysis in wind energy applications.
Procedure to Run determineHWZI.py Script on Windows:
(1). Install Python and Required Libraries. Ensure Python is installed on your computer. If not, download and install Python from python.org.
(2). Prepare Input Data. Ensure you have the 5 input files required by the script: 4 .csv files containing velocity field data from CFD simulations, and 1 .stl file containing topographic data of Lemukutan Island. Place all these files in a folder, for example, C:\HWZI_Project\
(3). Modify the Script (If Needed). Open the determineHWZI.py script using a text editor (e.g., Notepad++ or Visual Studio Code). Ensure the file paths for the input data are correct. Adjust the paths to reflect where your files are stored. 
(4). Run the Script. After preparing the input files and modifying the script, open Command Prompt (type cmd in the Start menu and press Enter). Navigate to the directory where the script determineHWZI.py is located by using the cd command. Run the script using the following command: python determineHWZI.py.
(5) Verify the Output. Once the script finishes running, check the output results generated by the script. The output might include: (a) Graphs or visualizations of wind velocity distribution. (b) Files containing the high-wind zone calculations (e.g., CSV files or images).
